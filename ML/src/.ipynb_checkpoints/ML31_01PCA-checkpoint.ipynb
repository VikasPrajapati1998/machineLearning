    "- ___“Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in machine learning and statistics. Its primary purpose is to transform a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional space while retaining as much of the original data’s variability as possible. In other words, PCA helps simplify complex datasets by finding a new set of orthogonal axes (principal components) along which the data points vary the most.”___\n",
